--- Changes from v.0.2 to v.0.3, June 2005 ---
	* Various bugfixes
	* Experimental code for playing moves instead of GNU Go

--- Changes from v.0.1 to v.0.2, May 2005 ---
	* Added mouse support. You can now play against GNU Go by clicking the left
	mousebutton
	* Added support for guessing your way through a SGF using the right
	mousebutton
	* Added support for going to the next step in an SGF with the middle
	mousebutton
	* Implemented my own SGF-reading rutine, since I was not satisfied with the
	way GNU Go handled them. GNU Go was unable to handle a couple of files I have
	that missed the SZ[19] setting in the header. Loading SGF-files with GNU Go,
	and then importing the moves via move_history turned out to be a buggy
	solution, since the coordinates I got out was completely strange. It works
	nicely for me now.

--- Changes from v.0.0 to v.0.1, April 2005 ---
	* Wrote everything from scratch, based on an unfinished drawingprogram of mine
	* Wrote the GTP-connection to GNU Go
	* Wrote the code for making the grid a Go-board
	* Created several commands, and made them available for keybinding
	* Wrote the textfiles

--- Planned features in v.0.3 ---
	* Support for branching in SGF-files
	* Nicer support of comments in SGF-files
	* A command for showing all the suggested next moves from GNU Go
	* Better placement of the letters and numbers
	* Selfmade 3D-images of stones and board
	* A selfmade menu at the top
	* A handicap-command that takes a number from 1 to 9
	* Automatically show final score when the game is finished
	* Understand when a group is out of liberties, without the help of GNU Go
	* XMLRPC-support, just to see if it will be useful
	* Graphical effects, like in Tetris, when stones disappear? ;)
	* Plugin-support?
	* An UML-diagram could be nice
