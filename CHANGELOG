Changes, July 2013
------------------

 * Theme support

 easier to package for Linux distros


Changes from v.0.2 to v.0.3, June 2005
--------------------------------------

 * Various bugfixes
 * Experimental code for playing moves instead of GNU Go


Changes from v.0.1 to v.0.2, May 2005
-------------------------------------

 * Added mouse support. You can now play against GNU Go by clicking the left mousebutton
 * Added support for guessing your way through a SGF using the right mousebutton
 * Added support for going to the next step in an SGF with the middle mousebutton
 * Implemented my own SGF-reading rutine, since I was not satisfied with the way GNU Go handled them. GNU Go was unable to handle a couple of files I have that missed the SZ[19] setting in the header. Loading SGF-files with GNU Go, and then importing the moves via move_history turned out to be a buggy solution, since the coordinates I got out was completely strange. It works nicely for me now.

---------------------------------------

 * Wrote everything from scratch, based on an unfinished drawingprogram of mine
 * Wrote the GTP-connection to GNU Go
 * Wrote the code for making the grid a Go-board
 * Created several commands, and made them available for keybinding
 * Wrote the textfiles
